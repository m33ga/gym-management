## Technical Details

### Project Structure

This project adheres to a Clean Architecture approach with separate layers for Presentation, Domain Model, and Infrastructure, implemented as separate Visual Studio projects. It uses the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern for effective data binding and a structured codebase.

#### Key Components
- **Presentation Layer**: Handles UI and user interactions, built with UWP XAML.
- **Domain Model Layer**: Encapsulates business logic, ensuring that the core functionality remains consistent.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Manages data access using Entity Framework Core with SQLite for data persistence.

### Database Structure

Entity Framework Core is used to map classes to database tables, providing a relational model. Key entities include:
- **Member**: Stores personal information, goals, and remaining workout sessions.
- **Trainer**: Manages availability and creates meal plans.
- **WorkoutSession**: Tracks session details such as date, time, and trainer.
- **Review**: Allows members to rate trainers after sessions.
- **MealPlan**: Customizable by trainers to suit member goals.
- **Notification**: Alerts members and trainers of relevant events.


### Development Tools and Libraries

- **Visual Studio 2022**: Primary development environment.
- **SQLite**: Database engine for data persistence.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database management.
- **Windows Community Toolkit**: Enhances UWP functionality.
- **WinUI**: Custom styling and controls.
- **MVVM**: Ensures structured data-binding and interaction.
- **Git/GitLab**: Version control and collaborative development.
